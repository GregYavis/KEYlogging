# KEYlogging readme initial
Hello this is one of my first serious projects.
Ther is quite a lot of information on the Internet Ñ„about how make a keylogger with Python. 
But not all of them are case-sensetive.
I solved this problem by using variables that register the state of the 'SHIFT', 'CTRL' and 'ALT' keys
and then transfer this state to the dictionary, whitch is written to the .txt file.
